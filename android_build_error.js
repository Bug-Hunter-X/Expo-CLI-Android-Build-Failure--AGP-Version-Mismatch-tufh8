This error occurs when using the Expo CLI to build an Android APK.  The build process fails and reports an error related to the Android Gradle Plugin (AGP) version incompatibility.  The exact error message may vary, but it typically involves a mismatch between the version required by Expo and the version installed in the Android environment.  This can happen due to updates to the Android SDK, Expo CLI, or Gradle itself.  The Expo CLI might attempt to use an older or newer version of AGP than what is available or supported on the system.
