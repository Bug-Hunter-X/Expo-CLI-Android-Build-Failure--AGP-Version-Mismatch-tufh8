Several approaches can resolve the AGP version mismatch:

**1. Update Android Gradle Plugin:**
Ensure your Android Gradle Plugin is up-to-date.  Use the Android Studio SDK Manager to update the AGP to a compatible version recommended by Expo for your SDK version.  After updating, clean and rebuild your project.

**2. Specify AGP Version (gradle.properties):**
In the `android/gradle.properties` file, explicitly define the AGP version that's compatible with your Expo setup.  For example:
```gradle
android.useAndroidX=true
android.enableJetifier=true
org.gradle.jvmargs=-Xmx4096m -XX:MaxMetaspaceSize=512m
AGP_VERSION=7.0.0 // Or another compatible version
```
This should match the version required by Expo for your specific setup. This approach overrides the AGP version automatically managed by Expo. 

**3. Clean and Rebuild:**
After any changes to the Gradle files, perform a clean build.  This can help eliminate any caching issues.
```bash
cd android
./gradlew clean
cd ..
expo build:android
```

**4. Check Expo SDK Version:**
The error might be caused by an older Expo SDK not supporting the latest AGP versions. Check for SDK updates and ensure you are using a compatible version. 

Remember to consult the official Expo documentation for the most accurate and up-to-date guidance on AGP version compatibility for your Expo SDK version.
